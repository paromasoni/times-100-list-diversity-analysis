# How Diverse Are Time's 100 Most Influential People?

Each year, beginning in 1999 (and digitally from 2004), TIMES Magazine releases a list of the 100 most influential people in the world for that year. Chosen exclusively by Time's editors after nominations from alumnae and international staff, the list features people who are "recognized for changing the world, regardless of the consequences of their actions."

Appearing on this list is generally considered an honor, and has thus generated controversy over whom it includes as well as excludes. While the list is presented as a reflection of the current state of the world, the editorial decisions behind it are telling of the power structures that shape our worldviews.

Here are Time's 100 Most Influential People from the years 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020, mapped by their nationalities/place of birth, and color coded for gender.
